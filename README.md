Technologies used:
SASS, React, React Redux.

A tiny project I've made in the past at the beginning of my React journey. It's a desert-themed memory card game. It's design is kinda unresponsive, but it's okay. The projects main purpose was to teach me Redux and it's pretty much all I required from it.
The project taught me a lot of react's tiny intricacies although I do remember the pain I had to go through to complete this project as it required some intermediate React knowledge, especially the component lifecycle, and I was a total noob back then. There's no point for me to try to
Fix this project, a total remake is the only option as the code is very old.
